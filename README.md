# K-GoodDreamer
My first Android app!! Made to practice and familiarize myself with Kotlin to later port K-WatchManager for Android.

Humans sleep in cycles of about 90min, when you wake up in a middle of a cycle we feel more tired than if we wake up at the end/begining of one.

This app tells you the next 8 cycles so you can choose the best time to wake up.
